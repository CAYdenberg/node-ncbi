# node-ncbi

A nodejs wrapper for the NCBI eUtils. You can use it to search PubMed or other databases and get the results as a JavaScript object.

[Read the full documentation of eUtils](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/).

## Getting started

`npm install --save node-ncbi`

`var ncbi = require('node-ncbi');`

### API Keys

eUtils now requires API keys to make **more than three requests per second** [You can read here about how to obtain an API key from NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/#chapter2.Coming_in_December_2018_API_Key).

Starting with v0.6.0 of `node-ncbi`, setting the environment variable `NCBI_API_KEY` will automatically append your key to all outgoing requests.

## Basic usage

### Performing a search

```js
const pubmed = ncbi.pubmed;
pubmed.search("actin").then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```

Will log

```
{
  count: (Number),
  papers: [
    raw: (Pubmed Summary object),
    pubDate: (String),
    title: (String),
    authors: (String),
    pmid: (Integer),
    pmc: (Integer if available),
    doi: (String if available)
  ]
}
```

where `count` is the total number of papers, independent of pagination. The "papers" represent PubMed "summaries" containing title, authors, journal and citation information, etc..

By default, 10 results will be retrieved at a time. To get the next set of results:

```javascript
pubmed.search("actin", 1).then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```

To change the number of results retrieved at a time:

```javascript
pubmed.search("actin", 0, 20).then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```

### Looking up a specific paper

```javascript
pubmed.summary(20517925).then((paper) => {
  console.log(paper);
});
```

where the only argument is a PMID (PubMed ID #).

In addition, following methods are available:

- `abstract()` - get the abstract
- `summary()` - get the "summary" - an object of fields containing title, authors, citation info, etc.
- `cites()` - papers which this paper cites.
- `citedBy()` - papers which cite this paper (only includes citing papers in PubMed central)
- `similar()` - papers similar to this one (similarity is calculated on NCBI's side of the API, not ours).
- `isOa()` - true if the full NLM XML can be retrieved ("Gold" open-access)
- `fulltext()` - the full NLM XML if available, null otherwise

All methods return a promise accessible by `.then()`; the value retrieved is passed to the promise.

## Contributing

I'd love to get PRs improving the code or expanding the search methods beyond PubMed.

You can build for development by navigating to the project folder and running `npm install`. You'll also need to have gulp installed globally `npm install -g gulp`.

### REPL

To help with creating Gateways are seeing the data structures returned by the API, node-ncbi provides a custom REPL. Start it with `npm start`. You can then run `url({object})` or `open({object})` where {object} is an object literal that looks like the following:

```javascript
utility: 'esearch',
params: {
  db: 'pubmed',
  term: query,
  retstart: start,
  retmax: resultsPerPage
}
```

`url` will log the URL needed to access eUtils while `open` will open that URL in a browser. This can help with debugging and to look at the actual data which is useful to create new queries. [See the full documentation of eUtils](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/) for more information on creating
queries.
